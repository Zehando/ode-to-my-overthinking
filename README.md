# Ode to My Overthinking

This repository is a tribute to the beautiful, winding, and sometimes delightfully over-engineered paths our minds can take when solving a problem. It's a collection of Python scripts born from moments of deep, intricate thought, where simple solutions were just too... simple.

## What's Inside

Currently, this repository features:

* **`pi_decimal_selector.py`**: A script that generates a list of random numbers and then, using the decimal places of Pi ($\pi$) as an arbitrarily complex selection criterion, chooses elements from that list. Because why use `random.choice()` when you can consult mathematical constants?

## Why "Ode to My Overthinking"?

The name encapsulates the spirit of this project perfectly. It's an acknowledgment, a celebration, and a gentle chuckle at the human tendency to sometimes think way, *way* too hard about things. It's an ode to the intricate thought processes that lead to wonderfully convoluted, yet functional, code.
